Although the phrases aren\'t identical, their core meaning is the same - representing a person\'s identity or individuality. The only difference is in the choice of words to convey the message.

The system output could be slightly more formal or academic in tone, which is why it doesn\'t get a perfect score.'"

The ground truth definition is clear about a person being involved in a contest or competition, whereas the system's output does not mention anything relevant or sensible."""
hoolot,light that comes from the Sun,you can only see hoolot during the day.,the moon is only bright because it reflects the hoolot from the sun.,the sun reflecting the sun,"'Score: 2/10\nReasoning: The system\'s output does not closely match the ground truth.

It does not define the concept of \'light that comes from the Sun\' correctly.'"
